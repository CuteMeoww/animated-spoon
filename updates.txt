Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes made to your files over time 1. It is widely used by developers to manage their code and collaborate with others. 
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and additional features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and code review.

To get started with Git and GitHub, you will need to install Git on your computer and create a GitHub account 1. Once you have done that, you can use Git to track changes made to your files and push them to your GitHub repository 1.

Some basic Git commands:

git init: Initializes a new Git repository.
git add: Adds a file to the staging area.
git commit: Commits changes to the repository.
git push: Pushes changes to a remote repository.
git pull: Pulls changes from a remote repository.
